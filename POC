Client Requirements: 

Staff should be able to communicate with guests via SMS 
This must include receiving messages from guests, Customized templates, and images.
Scheduled messages must be taken care of when the guest initiates the chat.
 Twilio SDKs
Twilio's SDKs are used to create video conversations, make VoIP phone calls, or implement real-time chat. Performing it on the browser can be done using Javascript SDKs; we also have ios SDKs and Android SDKs.
We can send SMS to guests by using Twilio Programmable Messaging Quickstart for C# with .NET Framework and responding to an incoming text message.
If we want to use a proxy server, we can also achieve it through Custom TwilioRestClients in either .net framework or.net core. 
We can also send notifications directly to the guest by SMS using notify feature provided by Twilio SDK.
The guest can receive voice responses if we implement a Programmable voice feature provided by server-side helper libraries. 
We can also send a message with an image URL directly to the guest and can also make an outbound phone call with c#
Listening to client events, Creating a channel, Listening to channel events, Joining other channels, and deleting a channel can also be done by Twilio SDKs.
